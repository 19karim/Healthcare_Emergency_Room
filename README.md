### Healthcare Emergency Room  
### This repository contains data related to patient records that has been transformed and visualized using Power BI. The data includes information such as patient demographics, satisfaction scores, and department referrals. The Power BI dashboard is created using Power Query for data transformation and loading, Power Pivot for creating measures using DAX expressions, and data modeling to establish relationships between different attributes. 
  



### Dataset:
- date: The date and time of the patient record entry.   
  

- patient_id: Unique identifier for each patient. 
  
  

- patient_gender: Gender of the patient (M/F). 

  
  

- patient_age: Age of the patient.
  
  

- patient_sat_score: Patient satisfaction score. 
  
  

- patient_first_inital: First initial of the patient's first name. 
  
  

- patient_last_name: Last name of the patient. 
  
  



### Usage:  
- patient_race: Race of the patient. 
  
  

- patient_admin_flag: Flag indicating whether the patient has administrative privileges (TRUE/FALSE). 
  
  

- patient_waittime: Time the patient had to wait before receiving service. 
  
  

- department_referral: Department to which the patient is referred.  
  



### Power BI Components: 
- Power Query: Power Query has been utilized to transform and load the data into Power BI. The data cleaning and transformation steps include handling missing values, formatting dates, and ensuring data consistency. These steps ensure that the data is ready for analysis and visualization.  
  

- Power Pivot: Power Pivot has been employed to create measures using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) expressions. These measures provide insights into the data by calculating aggregated values such as average satisfaction scores, age distribution and wait time analysis. DAX expressions enable dynamic and complex calculations based on the dataset.  
  

- Data Modelling: Data modeling is a crucial aspect of the Power BI dashboard creation process. Relationships have been established between different attributes to enable seamless navigation and analysis. For example, a relationship may exist between patient demographics and department referrals, allowing users to analyze the distribution of referrals based on patient characteristics.  
  



### Dashboard Visualizations:  
- Matrix- Avg. Satisfaction & Avg. Wait Time: Displays average satisfaction scores and wait times.  
  

-  Line Chart- Total Patients by Year: Illustrates yearly patient distribution.   
  

- Stacked Bar Chart- Patients by Age Group: Shows distribution across different age groups.  
  

-  Stacked Column Chart- Patients by Quarter: Represents quarterly patient volumes.   
  

- Area Chart- Patients by Month: Depicts monthly patient numbers.   
  

-  Stacked Bar Chart- Patients by Referral Dept.: Highlights distribution across referral departments.   
  

- Tree Table- Gender Distribution: Displays the distribution of patients by gender.  
  



### To explore the Power BI dashboard:  
Ensure you have Power BI Desktop installed. Open the Power BI Desktop application. Load the provided dataset into Power BI using Power Query. Utilize Power Pivot to create and customize measures using DAX expressions. Establish relationships between relevant attributes in the data model. Design and customize the dashboard visualizations based on your analysis requirements. Feel free to explore and interact with the dashboard to gain insights into the patient data.
